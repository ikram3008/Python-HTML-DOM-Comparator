### **Project: Python HTML DOM Comparator**  

#### **Description:**  
The **Python HTML DOM Comparator** is a tool designed to compare the **Document Object Models (DOM)** of two HTML files and identify differences. It parses both HTML files into tree structures, computes unique hashes for integrity verification, and highlights mismatches in tags, attributes, text content, and structural hierarchy.  

#### **Features:**  

âœ… Parses and converts HTML into a structured tree format  
âœ… Detects differences in **tags, attributes, text content, and child elements**  
âœ… Uses **SHA-256 hashing** to verify HTML integrity  
âœ… Outputs a structured **JSON report** with identified discrepancies  
âœ… Handles missing nodes, extra elements, and structural inconsistencies  

#### **Use Cases:**  
ðŸ”¹ Web developers comparing different HTML versions  
ðŸ”¹ QA testers verifying UI consistency  
ðŸ”¹ Detecting unauthorized or unexpected changes in webpages  

Future Improvements:

âœ… Better Logging: Display real-time comparison results in the terminal for easier debugging.
âœ… GUI Support: Develop a simple GUI (using Tkinter or Streamlit) for user-friendly interaction.
âœ… More Error Handling: Improve handling of missing or invalid HTML files.
âœ… Performance Optimization: Enhance tree traversal efficiency for large HTML files.

This tool is useful for web developers and testers who need to track HTML changes over time. ðŸš€
